    <description>
      A generic data generation class library.

      Useful when you want to play around with LINQ or just want some random data to work with.

      Works on .Net4.6 and .Net4.5
    </description>
<releaseNotes>
  1: This is the first major release which means the syntax will not be changed as much anymore.
  2: Factory pattern is back and is optional, you can either use factory or use Generator and provide Randomizer as TSource.
  3: Randomizer method Name is now got renamed to String, Randomizer method Number is now called Integer.
  The factory class also got a a method which takes an IRandomizer&lt;StringArg&gt; 
  if you want to create your own implementation of randomizer.
  4: you now pass the delegate on the methods that will generate rather than on the construction of the Generator.
  this makes it much more flexible and allows the same generator to generate multiple types.
