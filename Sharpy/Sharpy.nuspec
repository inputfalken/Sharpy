    <releaseNotes>
      1.1:
      1: Generating random items can now be done by using static methods from RandomGenerato class.
         This is useful if you do not want to configure anything and just and some random data.
      1.0:
        1: This is the first major release which means the syntax will not be changed as much anymore.
        2: Factory pattern is back but is used on the Generator classes now.
        3: Randomizer method Name got renamed to String and Randomizer method Number got renamed to Integer.
        4: you now pass delegates on the methods from the generator object rather than on the construction of the Generator.
         this makes it much more flexible and allows the same generator to generate multiple types.
        5: Configuring is now done from a property on the RandomGenerator instance.
