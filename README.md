# Sharpy 2.2.0

This is a hobby project of mine where the goal is to have an easy way of generating some fake data.

To generate data you can either map the generator by calling Generate/GenerateSequence or use the methods given by the generator.

Use the following link for [API-Reference](https://inputfalken.github.io/sharpy-API/)
