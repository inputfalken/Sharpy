# Sharpy 2.0.0

This is a hobby project of mine where the goal is to have an easy way of generating some fake data.

It works abit like Select from LINQ. Except that the in parameter is the Generator.

Examples are now moved to a seperate page since it cluttered this page.

Use the following link for [Examples](https://inputfalken.github.io/Sharpy/)
